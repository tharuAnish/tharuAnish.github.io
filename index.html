                encompasses any kind of learning that takes place via the <a

                opportunity to reach students who may not be able to enroll in a traditional classroom course and
                supports students who need to work on their own schedule and at their own pace. <br>

                The quantity of distance learning and online degrees in most disciplines is large and increasing
                rapidly. Schools and institutions that offer online learning are also increasing in number. Students
                pursuing degrees via the online approach must be selective to ensure that their coursework is done
                through a respected and credentialed institution.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Online education has become a viable and exciting method for
                instructional delivery in the global business society that runs on a 24/7 schedule (24 hours a day/7
                days a week) because it provides students with great flexibility. <br>

                With the increased availability of the Internet and computer technology, students are able to access
                information anytime and anyplace that would normally be available only through a traditional classroom.
                Studies have shown that students learn just as effectively in an online classroom as they do in the
                traditional classroom.</p>

                With enhanced software, hardware, and Internet access, more options for online education will become
                available. With student enrollments increasing faster than classrooms can be built, students becoming
                more proficient with technology, and students pursuing an education that meets their needs, the future
                of online education will continue to grow. Online degree programs will become more widely accepted as
                they become a more common practice.
